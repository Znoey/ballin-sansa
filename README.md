An addon for Ghasta.
This is my second attempt at creating my own addon.  At some point, ghasta mentioned that he wanted a master-loot assisting addon for raids.  His description is a little vague, but he wants something matching some of these features:
* Quickly announce the loot to raid-warning chat.
* Quickly start rolls on specific pieces of gear.
* Dispense gear to roll winner.
     Most, if not all, of this is possible.  And the initial attempt i have already done shows that i can pick up the roll message
